<h2> I am a transfer graphic design student. Taking Advanced Web Design because I want to improve on designing websites. I hope to achieve in this online class a better understanding and feel more comfortable using codes. This semester I am taking five design classes! They are Intro to Computer Art, Typography 2, Vis Comm and Graphics Design 2, Advance Web Design, and Experience Design. I have enjoyed every class I have taken but my favorite has to be Digital Theory and Skills. I took that class my first semester at Millersville University and I just loved every project the professor made us do. My passion is shoes, I love shoes! I enjoy making, designing and shopping for shoes. I would like to work in a design agency or advertising but my dream job is to be a footwear designer! </h2>
